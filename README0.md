# What I'm most excited for in CPSC 350
  I am looking forward to learning about the various types of data strucutres and the best implementation for them. I hope to be able to expand and further develop
  my skills as a programmer by having a better understanding of how to implement the most efficient data strucutre type for a given task. I am also eager to 
  gain a deeper understanding of computer science thorugh this class and continue to build upon skills I developed before this course. Additionally, I am looking forward 
  to the the skills I will develop during this semester and seeing how they will translate to future courses and professinal career settings beyond Chapman's computer science 
  program.
